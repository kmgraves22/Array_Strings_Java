This program takes in a single string and determines if all the characters are unique.
In this implementation no data storage is used decreasing the required memory as I used an list in my python solution to this problem.
However, this raised the complexity to O(n^2).  Assuming it is used on a relatively short or small data set this will be optimal
in reducing memory allocation.
