This program takes in two strings and determines whether the strings are permutations of each other.  It has O(n^2) complexity
which is a bit of an issue and there are algorithms to solve this problem with lower complexity but this solution was my
initial thinking in solving this problem.  For my python solution of this problem I will implement one of the more efficient
algorithms.
